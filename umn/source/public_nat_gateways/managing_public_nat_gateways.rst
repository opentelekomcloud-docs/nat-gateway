Managing Public NAT Gateways
============================

Scenarios
---------

After a public NAT gateway is created, you can modify the name, specifications, or description of it. You can also delete public NAT gateways that are no longer needed to release resources and reduce costs.

Using a public NAT gateway of more robust specifications does not affect services, but if you switch to a public NAT gateway of less robust specifications, ensure that its capacity can still be enough to meet your service requirements.

.. note::

   -  If you downgrade a NAT gateway, make sure that the new specification can meet your service requirements.
   -  Upgrading a NAT gateway does not affect services.
