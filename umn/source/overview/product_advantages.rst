Product Advantages
==================

The NAT Gateway service has the following highlights:

-  Flexibility

   A NAT gateway is deployed across subnets and across two AZs. Any fault in a single AZ does not affect the service continuity of a NAT gateway. The specifications and EIP of a NAT gateway can be adjusted at any time.

-  Easy of use

   Multiple NAT gateway specifications are available. You can use them after simple configuration. NAT Gateway supports easy operation and maintenance (O&M) and quick provisioning. They can run stably and reliably.

-  Cost-effectiveness

   Multiple servers can share an EIP. When you send data through a private IP address or provide services accessible from the Internet using a NAT gateway, the NAT gateway translates the private IP address to a public IP address. The NAT Gateway service helps you save money on EIPs and bandwidth.
