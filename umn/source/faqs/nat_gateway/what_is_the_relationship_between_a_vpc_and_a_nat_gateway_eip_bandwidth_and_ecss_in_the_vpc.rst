What Is the Relationship Between a VPC and a NAT Gateway, EIP Bandwidth, and ECSs in the VPC?
=============================================================================================

-  A VPC is a secure, isolated, logical network environment.
-  The NAT gateway enables ECSs in the VPC to access the Internet.
-  EIP is a service that provides valid static IP addresses on the Internet. The throughput of a VPC is determined by the EIP bandwidth.
-  ECSs are instances running in the VPC and use the NAT gateway to access the Internet.
