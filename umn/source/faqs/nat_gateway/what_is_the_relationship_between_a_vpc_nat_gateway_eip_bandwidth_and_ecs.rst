What Is the Relationship Between a VPC, NAT Gateway, EIP Bandwidth, and ECS?
============================================================================

-  A VPC is a secure, isolated, logical network environment.
-  A NAT gateway enables ECSs in the VPC to access the Internet.
-  EIP is a service that provides valid static IP addresses on the Internet. The throughput of a VPC is determined by the EIP bandwidth.
-  An ECS is a running instance in the VPC and uses the NAT gateway to access the Internet.
