What Is the Relationship Between a VPC, Public NAT Gateway, EIP Bandwidth, and ECS?
===================================================================================

-  A VPC is a secure, isolated, logical network environment.
-  A public NAT gateway enables ECSs in a VPC to access the Internet.
-  EIP is a service that provides valid static IP addresses on the Internet. The throughput of a VPC is determined by the EIP bandwidth.
-  An ECS is an instance running in a VPC and uses a public NAT gateway to access the Internet.
