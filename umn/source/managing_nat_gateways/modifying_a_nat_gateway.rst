Modifying a NAT Gateway
=======================

Scenarios
---------

This section describes how to modify the name, type, or description of a NAT gateway.

Increasing the size of the NAT gateway type does not affect services, but if you switch to a smaller NAT gateway, make sure the reduced capacity will still be enough to meet your service requirements.

Prerequisites
-------------

A NAT gateway has been created.

Procedure
---------

#. Log in to the management console.

#. Click |image1| in the upper left corner and select the desired region and project.

#. Under **Network**, choose **NAT Gateway**.

#. On the displayed page, locate the row that contains the target NAT gateway and click **Modify** in the **Operation** column.

#. Modify the name, type, or description of the NAT gateway as prompted.

#. Click **Next**.

#. Click **Submit**.
