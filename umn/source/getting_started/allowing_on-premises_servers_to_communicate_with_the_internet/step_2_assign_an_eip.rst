Step 2: Assign an EIP
=====================

Scenarios
---------

You can assign an EIP, which can work together with a NAT gateway to allow servers that are connected to a public cloud system using Direct Connect or VPN to access the Internet or to provide services accessible from the Internet.

Procedure
---------

For details, see `Assigning an EIP <https://docs.otc.t-systems.com/elastic-ip/umn/>`__. After obtaining the EIP, you do not need to bind it to a server.
