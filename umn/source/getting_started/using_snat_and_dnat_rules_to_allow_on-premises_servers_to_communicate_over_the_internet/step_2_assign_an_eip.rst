Step 2: Assign an EIP
=====================

Scenarios
---------

You can assign an EIP, which can work together with a NAT gateway to allow servers that are connected to public cloud system using Direct Connect or VPN to access the Internet or to provide services accessible from the Internet.

Procedure
---------

For details, see the *Elastic IP User Guide*. After you assign an EIP, you do not need to bind it to a server here.
